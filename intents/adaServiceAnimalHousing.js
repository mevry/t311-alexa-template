            `The Fair Housing Act, passed in 1968, provides protection from discrimination in housing. The definition of a service animal is any guide dog, single dog or other animal individually trained to perform tasks for the benefit of a disabled individual, including guiding visually impaired individuals, alerting hearing-impaired individuals, pulling a wheelchair or fetching items. All service animals must be allowed. The waiver to the "no pets" rule to allow a person with a disability to have a service animal constitutes a reasonable accommodation. A landlord may not charge any type of deposit/surcharge/cleaning fee to a disabled individual as a condition to allow a service animal to accompany the individual, even if the business has a policy of charging customers fees/deposits for pets. For more information, please contact the City's Fair Housing Investigator at (253) 591-5151.`
